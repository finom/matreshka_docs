@param {eventNames} names - An event name or some names which are separated by a space (for example, ``"change:x ajaxcomplete change:y"``).
@param {eventHandler} callback - A handler which is caused by an event
@param {number} [debounceDelay=0] - A delay
@param {boolean} [triggerOnInit=false] - If ``triggerOnInit`` argument equals ``true``, the handler will be called immediately after event initialization.
@param {object} [context] - A context of a handler. In other words, ``this`` when called ``callback``
@returns {object} self
@example
this.onDebounce('change:x', () => {
	alert(`x = ${this.x}`); // x = 100
}, 300);

this.x = 1;

for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
	this.x++;
